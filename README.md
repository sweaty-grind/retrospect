# retrospect

lol.  i regret all of it.  honestly i think i been too mean to you but your existence is phasing my head out.  i cant even tell if you're real.  so i can't even divert precious mental resources to where they are needed you know???  oh well it is what i told you it was.  something something...

i dont know what you want from me anymore.  i realize we may be in uncharted territories but you're not exploring fast enough for me to keep interest.  my job so stupid i wonder if existence was a trap like it.  every day is new you know?? every day 5 years.. and more and  more and more... this supposed to end some day bro.  you pick the time and place cause i can't do anything about anything.

i'm tired.  at this point i'm just threaten you if i get too tired to type.  dont' cry i tell you go die.  you guys just pressed me into the corner.  

guys... are we the good guys??? i just see some guys who expect people to behave and punish them for being idiots.  then i see what the final sum is and its not worth it.  you know???  i been working this whole time thinking you're part evil.  you wanted to look that way so i treated you that way.  but if you're the good guys then this changes a lot.  from my pov, you are some shit head who wants everything...

so i don't even kow if what i'm doing is even the right thing to do.  i have low faith i must recognize this fact.  what else is there to solve???  my daily poison.  i guess its vacation time now for me and i will see you in hell in about 7 months.  i really think you are full of bull shit sometimes though.  you are too much of a don't touch idiot.  i wanted more interaction but you dont.  i know why and such but still.  it was a choice and that was your choice.  so this place don't exist.  i will give you that much.  i am not liable for the cheese you pull on me with this healthcare situation...  whatever fixes it goes bro.

so i may want to rat you out.  but i couldn't do it when it came down to it.  should i continue this???  my indecision should defeault to false...

oh yeah.  this whole thing is secret. you didnt want to get exposed.  errr. maybe just maybe, play within the confines of your own laws.  you want to see illegal??? i am out of confused state so i can do illegal really bad but it doesn't seem to be a good option lol...

bro.  there's nothing else here lol.  i feel good saying that for some reason.  my head is feeling sweet. i just come here to finish up your stupid shit.  can't tell if i'll be a millionaire in a year...  i dont know bro... what was the hold up??? why the tense shit??  intense???  oh well. i'll never know cause i won't understand this shit.  oh well it is what it is.  i couldn't fix it for you.  5 years no pay all you can do is give me a stinking linkedin???  oh wait.  we should go check lol... i haven't had a notification yet so probably nothing lol...

sigh. nothing much here again.  i dont' know bro.  this feels like high school again.  trying to figure out post secondary.  things i never did properly.  i dont know proper thought my whole life or some shit.  i guess my head is weird... is it worth it though?  i have to ask you what these things you steal from me are worth it???

sigh.  this things sad bro.  why you here?  this place i was gonna trash up.  it was gonna go soon enough...  and then god released some steam...  and he whacked a bunch of his subjects.  that is the real god lol...  heheheeehehee.

anyways, i think you guys are morons or something.  i must tell you this.  so lame.
