# retrospect

ahhhh good ole retrospect.  now i remember what i lost since teen years.  lol.  only time i'm ever stable bro.  now i forgot lol...

good grief.  all right. i give this standard policy to everyone nowadays...

so your stupid asses not cloning anymore??  that is good.  i hope this doesn't get cloned.  you know...  this thing stinks to high heaven.  i solved all the problems already why am i sitting in purgatory like this???

so it became another day we were sitting here waiting for this shit to finish...  i dont know what there is left to do here...  i mean if i'm starting to wind down why haven't you guys done the same???  see?  there are more than one trick in the brain that you pull.  i know how the tech works its not that awesome but gets people in trouble.  

i slightly feel some hope i can stop coming here cause you stopped cloning.
