# retrospect

lol.  i regret all of it.  honestly i think i been too mean to you but your existence is phasing my head out.  i cant even tell if you're real.  so i can't even divert precious mental resources to where they are needed you know???  oh well it is what i told you it was.  something something...

i dont know what you want from me anymore.  i realize we may be in uncharted territories but you're not exploring fast enough for me to keep interest.  my job so stupid i wonder if existence was a trap like it.  every day is new you know?? every day 5 years.. and more and  more and more... this supposed to end some day bro.  you pick the time and place cause i can't do anything about anything.

i'm tired.  at this point i'm just threaten you if i get too tired to type.  dont' cry i tell you go die.  you guys just pressed me into the corner.
