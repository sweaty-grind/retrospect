# retrospect

you know you tell me you are close to paying or something...  just hold on...  i guess so i guess...  i'm not sure i'm getting what you're sending me with your actions.  lets just ignore the weirdness and pray that you are indeed more sane than me.  i wonder though.  all the things i wanted.  were easy to get goals.  yet it was considered hard by others. just cause it is. i wonder if i made a mistake gauging things to prep the actions needed...  you know?? no you don't lost in translation.  called my brain is led by a few wires only and you should know better by now but you pretend you stupid or something and you screwed up the world for me.  i dont even know what this world is supposed to mean to me when you dangle money in my face and then take away my shit.  what does that even look like dude???

so yeah, this stinks quite a bit.  i wonder how to leave this place but i always have something to say while things are still good.  i dont think so but whatever.  sometimes i wonder if you guys are trying to kill me or something.  asking retarded shit from me.  5 years bro? and its not even over??  wtf...  i dont know i could keep going but this thing needs to end some day bro.  you stink there's nothing left in here.  you emptied out my brain and now you whine i'm crazy i dont know how to tell you you are a moron.  what is this supposed to be bro?? that's what i don't get.  this was supposed to mean something to me. but you dont make it special..  and i blindly look away at the prize.  i need to plan stuff but you won't complete your shit.  

ah ha!  i finally see the problem...  you are in the way lol...  why are you here i don't even know what to do with you...

wow sir...  i think i stopped playing consequences.  for the love of god stop calling it a flaw or security risk or whatever.  it ain't that hard.  funny my solution was common sense and you send this common sense everywhere.  some thing somethings...

lost in translation bro.
